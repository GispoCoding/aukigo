This application is designed for fetching service information including opening hours from [OpenStreetMap](www.openstreetmap.org) in a defined area. 

AukiGO application can be used for travel purposes and checking the opening hours for different services. At the moment the services are divided into six categories:

- Accommodation
- Shopping
- Restaurants
- Transportation
- Healthcare
- Entertainment

AukiGO admin level users can be travel agencies, entrepeneurs, municipalities, cities or NGOs. For nation wide application, please consult Gispo Ltd. The idea is to serve the regions travellers and visitors with an easy application shownng the main services available in the region. Compared to e.g. Google Maps, the application shows all the services within the requested categories if they are added to OpenStreetMap.
